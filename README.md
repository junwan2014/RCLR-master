# RCLR-master
A matlab implementation of "Low-Rank Linear Embedding for Robust Clustering", which has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 2021. The demo in the package can be executed directly.  In the demo, Iris dataset and its ground truth are involved. The users can use other datasets instead of Iris. If the used dataset is high-dimensional, the PCA technique is suggested to speed up the executions.
